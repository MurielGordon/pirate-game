# pirate-game

Exercise 45 from Learn Python the Hard Way

## Quick Start

This program is written in Python 3. There are formatting aspects of it that make it incompatible with python 2 and below.

It consists of a game, pirate_game.py, and three mini programs that you must import into pirate_game.py for the game to work.
These mini programs are roshambo.py, sea_shanty.py, and skull.py. 

The smaller files are to fulfill requirement #2 of exercise 45:
"Use more than one file, and use import to use them."

Each file must be saved as separate files in the same folder so that they can be referenced by pirate_game.py.
