# pirate-game

pirate-game.py is the actual game itself.

roshambo.py and sea_shanty.py are files created to fulfill requirement #2:
"Use more than one file, and use import to use them."
You will need to create files for both to run pirate-game.py.

skull.py can be ignored. It's cute and I use it to test things. For now.
