# pirate-game

Exercise 45 from Learn Python the Hard Way

## Quick Start

This program is written in Python 3. 

It consists of a game, pirate-game.py, and three mini programs that you must import for the game to work.
These mini programs are roshambo.py, sea_shanty.py, and skull.py.

The smaller files are to fulfill requirement #2:
"Use more than one file, and use import to use them."

You will need to create files for all three mini programs to run pirate-game.py.
