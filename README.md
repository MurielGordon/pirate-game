# pirate-game

Exercise 45 from Learn Python the Hard Way

## Quick Start

This program is written in Python 3. 

It consists of a game, pirate-game.py, and two (soon to be three) files that you must import for the game to work.

The smaller files are to fulfill requirement #2:
"Use more than one file, and use import to use them."

You will need to create files for both to run pirate-game.py.

skull.py can be ignored. It's cute and I use it to test things. For now.
